# Curses Error Handling in LVM Browser

## Overview of the Issue

The LVM Browser application was experiencing a "Curses error: addwstr() returned ERR" error when the user input was focused in the main Volume Group screen (left panel). This document explains the cause of this error and the implemented solution.

## Understanding the Error

### What is "addwstr() returned ERR"?

In the curses library, the `addwstr()` function (and by extension, the Python `addstr()` method) returns an error (ERR) when it attempts to write text outside the boundaries of a window. This can happen when:

1. Text is too long for the available width
2. Attempting to write at coordinates outside the window
3. The terminal window is resized to be smaller than expected

When this error occurs and isn't handled, it propagates as an exception that can crash the application.

### Root Cause Analysis

The LVM Browser displays information in multiple panels with potentially long text strings. The error occurred because:

1. Some text strings (like volume group names, device paths, etc.) could be longer than the available space
2. The application didn't have proper boundary checking or error handling for all `addstr()` calls
3. Panel focus changes and window resizing could cause coordinates to become invalid

## Implemented Solution

### Error Handling Strategy

The solution implemented uses a comprehensive error handling approach:

1. **Try/Except Blocks**: Wrap all `addstr()` calls in try/except blocks to catch and handle `curses.error` exceptions
2. **Text Truncation**: Ensure text strings are truncated to fit within available space
3. **Boundary Checking**: Add explicit checks to prevent writing outside window boundaries
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Skip drawing elements that won't fit rather than crashing

### Code Patterns Used

Three main patterns were used throughout the codebase:

1. **Simple Error Handling**:
   ```python
   try:
       panel.addstr(y, x, text)
   except curses.error:
       # Skip if we can't write this line
       pass
   ```

2. **Text Truncation with Error Handling**:
   ```python
   try:
       formatted_text = f"Some label: {value}"
       # Ensure we don't write beyond window width
       max_width = panel_width - margin
       if len(formatted_text) > max_width:
           formatted_text = formatted_text[:max_width]
       panel.addstr(y, x, formatted_text)
   except curses.error:
       # Skip if we can't write this line
       pass
   ```

3. **Boundary Checking Before Writing**:
   ```python
   if y < panel_height - 1:  # Ensure we don't write outside boundaries
       try:
           panel.addstr(y, x, text)
       except curses.error:
           pass
   ```

### Key Areas Modified

#### 1. Panel Titles and Headers

All panel titles and table headers were wrapped in error handling:

```python
try:
    pv_panel.addstr(0, 2, " Physical Volumes (PV) ", title_attr)
except curses.error:
    # Skip if we can't write the header (probably out of bounds)
    pass
```

#### 2. Information Display Sections

Logical volume information sections were modified with error handling:

```python
try:
    right.addstr(2, 2, f"Device: {path}")
    right.addstr(3, 2, f"VG Name: {vg_name if vg_name else 'Unknown'}")
    right.addstr(4, 2, f"LV Name: {lv_name if lv_name else 'Unknown'}")
    right.addstr(5, 2, f"Size: {format_size(dev.get('size', 'N/A'))}")
except curses.error:
    # Skip if we can't write the information
    pass
```

#### 3. Tabular Data

Table rows with potentially long content were modified to both truncate content and handle errors:

```python
try:
    formatted_str = "{:<10} {:<10} {:>10} {:>10} {:<20} {}".format(
        le_start, le_end, str(pe_count), pe_size, clean_pvlist, pe_start_info)
    # Ensure we don't write beyond window width
    max_line_width = vg_width - 6  # Allow for borders and margin
    if len(formatted_str) > max_line_width:
        formatted_str = formatted_str[:max_line_width]
    right.addstr(y, 4, formatted_str)
except curses.error:
    # Skip this line if we can't write it (probably out of bounds)
    pass
```

#### 4. Status Messages

Even simple status messages were wrapped in error handling:

```python
try:
    block_dev_panel.addstr(1, 2, "No block devices available")
except curses.error:
    # Skip if we can't write the message
    pass
```

## Best Practices for Curses Applications

Based on this fix, here are some best practices for developing robust curses applications:

1. **Always handle curses errors**: Wrap all drawing operations in try/except blocks
2. **Implement text truncation**: Ensure text fits within available space
3. **Check boundaries before writing**: Verify coordinates are valid
4. **Test with different terminal sizes**: Ensure your application works with various dimensions
5. **Implement graceful degradation**: Skip drawing elements that won't fit rather than crashing
6. **Provide clear error messages**: When errors can't be handled silently, display user-friendly error messages
7. **Add resize handlers**: Redraw the interface appropriately when the terminal is resized

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. Run the application with a normal terminal size
2. Gradually resize the terminal to smaller dimensions
3. Tab through different panels to test focus handling
4. Navigate to items with long text strings
5. Test with complex LVM configurations with many volumes

The application should now handle all these scenarios without crashing, either displaying truncated information or gracefully skipping content that won't fit.
