Test UI Restructuring - Removal of Block Devices and Enhanced Logical Volume Display

This test verifies the changes made to the UI structure:
1. Removal of Block Devices panel
2. Full width usage for Volume Group and Physical Volumes panels
3. Enhanced Logical Volume information display
4. Proper spacing between information and tabular data
5. Updated docstrings
