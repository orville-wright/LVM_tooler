# Understanding LVM Concepts

## Introduction to Logical Volume Management

Logical Volume Management (LVM) is a device mapper framework that provides logical volume management for the Linux kernel. It's a powerful tool for managing disk space that offers more flexibility than traditional partitioning schemes.

This document explains key LVM concepts to help you better understand the information displayed in the LVM Browser application.

## Core LVM Components

LVM consists of three main components organized in a hierarchy:

### 1. Physical Volumes (PVs)

**Definition**: Physical Volumes are regular block devices (like hard drives or partitions) that have been initialized for use by LVM.

**Characteristics**:
- Created using the `pvcreate` command
- Can be whole disks or partitions
- Contain metadata describing the structure of the LVM data
- Divided into fixed-size Physical Extents (PEs)

**In LVM Browser**: The Physical Volumes panel displays all PVs associated with a selected Volume Group.

### 2. Volume Groups (VGs)

**Definition**: A Volume Group is a collection of Physical Volumes combined into a single logical storage unit.

**Characteristics**:
- Created using the `vgcreate` command
- Contains one or more Physical Volumes
- Serves as a pool of storage from which Logical Volumes are allocated
- Has a defined PE (Physical Extent) size that applies to all PVs in the group

**In LVM Browser**: The Volume Group panel (left side) shows all details about the selected VG, including its format, size, and associated Logical Volumes.

### 3. Logical Volumes (LVs)

**Definition**: Logical Volumes are created from the available space in Volume Groups and function like partitions.

**Characteristics**:
- Created using the `lvcreate` command
- Can be formatted with different filesystems
- Can span multiple Physical Volumes within a Volume Group
- Can be resized, moved, and snapshotted without disrupting service
- Comprised of Logical Extents (LEs) that map to Physical Extents (PEs)

**In LVM Browser**: The Volume Group panel lists all Logical Volumes in the selected VG, showing details like capacity, mount points, and extent allocation.

## LVM Extent Concepts

### Physical Extents (PEs)

- The smallest allocatable unit of storage in LVM
- Fixed size within a Volume Group (commonly 4MB, but can be configured)
- Allocated to Logical Volumes when they are created
- Each PE on a Physical Volume can be mapped to exactly one LE on a Logical Volume

### Logical Extents (LEs)

- The smallest unit of space allocation for a Logical Volume
- 1:1 mapping with Physical Extents
- Logical Volumes consist of a contiguous range of LEs
- LEs are mapped to specific PEs on Physical Volumes

## Advanced LVM Features

### Linear vs. Striped Logical Volumes

**Linear Volumes**: 
- Default type of Logical Volume
- Data is written to the first PV until full, then to the next
- Simpler but potentially slower for large files

**Striped Volumes**:
- Data is distributed across multiple PVs
- Improved read/write performance through parallelization
- Similar concept to RAID 0

### LVM Snapshots

- Point-in-time copies of a Logical Volume
- Used for backups, testing changes, or creating consistent copies
- Only track changes from the original volume (copy-on-write)
- Temporary by nature; not a replacement for backups

### Thin Provisioning

- Allows allocation of more storage space than physically available
- Space is only consumed when actually written to
- Useful for environments where not all allocated space will be used
- Requires monitoring to prevent running out of physical space

## Common LVM Operations

### Creating LVM Components

1. Create Physical Volumes: `pvcreate /dev/sdX`
2. Create Volume Group: `vgcreate vg_name /dev/sdX /dev/sdY`
3. Create Logical Volume: `lvcreate -n lv_name -L size vg_name`

### Extending Storage

1. Add new Physical Volume: `pvcreate /dev/sdZ`
2. Extend Volume Group: `vgextend vg_name /dev/sdZ`
3. Extend Logical Volume: `lvextend -L +size /dev/vg_name/lv_name`
4. Resize filesystem: `resize2fs /dev/vg_name/lv_name`

### Removing LVM Components

1. Remove Logical Volume: `lvremove /dev/vg_name/lv_name`
2. Remove Physical Volume from VG: `vgreduce vg_name /dev/sdX`
3. Remove Volume Group: `vgremove vg_name`
4. Remove Physical Volume marking: `pvremove /dev/sdX`

## LVM Metadata

LVM stores metadata about PVs, VGs, and LVs in a special area at the beginning of each Physical Volume. This metadata includes:

- The unique identifier (UUID) for each component
- Size and extent information
- Mappings between Logical Extents and Physical Extents
- Volume Group properties like PE size

This metadata is critical for LVM operation and is automatically backed up when changes are made.

### Volume Group Panel Information

- **VG Format**: Indicates the metadata format version
- **VG seg size**: The Physical Extent size used in this Volume Group
- **Logical Vols**: Names of Logical Volumes in this VG
- **Free space**: Unused capacity in the Volume Group

### Logical Volume Details

- **Mounted**: Where the Logical Volume is mounted, if applicable
- **Capacity**: Total size of the Logical Volume
- **Used**: Amount of space used on the filesystem
- **Available**: Remaining space on the filesystem

### Extent Tables

The extent tables show:
- **LE Start/End**: The range of Logical Extents in the segment
- **PE Count**: Number of Physical Extents allocated
- **PE Size**: Size of the extent allocation
- **PVs**: Which Physical Volumes contain these extents
- **PE Start**: Starting Physical Extent numbers on the PVs

This mapping is key to understanding how your logical storage is physically distributed across devices.

## Benefits of Using LVM

1. **Flexibility**: Easily resize, move, and manage storage without downtime
2. **Snapshots**: Create point-in-time copies for backups or testing
3. **Striping**: Improve performance by distributing I/O across devices
4. **Mirroring**: Enhance reliability through redundancy
5. **Thin Provisioning**: Optimize storage utilization
6. **Storage Pools**: Manage multiple devices as a single logical resource

Understanding these concepts will help you better interpret the information displayed in the LVM Browser and make more informed decisions about your storage architecture.
